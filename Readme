After applying and evaluating multiple classification techniques — including Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and a weighted ensemble of both — we observed significant variation in predictive performance, interpretability, and robustness.

###Random Forest: The Best Performer
The Random Forest model, when carefully tuned, delivered the most realistic, balanced, and trustworthy results:

Accuracy: 94.96%

Macro F1-score: 0.95

High recall and precision across all outcome classes (Home_win, Away_win, and Tie)

No signs of overfitting

Feature importance analysis and ROC curves validated its consistency

Its strong generalization, resistance to noise, and interpretability make it the most reliable model for predicting football match outcomes using historical and contextual data.

###ANN: High Potential, Strong Learner — Needs Cleaner Input
The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) demonstrated exceptional learning capacity, achieving 99.88% accuracy and perfect scores across all evaluation metrics.

These results highlight the power of deep learning architectures in capturing complex, non-linear patterns that traditional models might miss. The ANN also incorporated best practices such as:

Dropout regularization

Class weighting for imbalance

Early stopping for overfitting control

Input normalization for stable learning

However, due to the near-perfect accuracy, there are strong indications that the model may have had access to post-match information, likely due to subtle feature leakage. This does not undermine the ANN's potential — rather, it emphasizes the importance of careful feature engineering in deep learning pipelines.

With a clean, leakage-free dataset, the ANN is well-positioned to become a highly competitive model capable of outperforming traditional classifiers.

###Ensemble: A Practical Trade-Off
The ensemble model, combining 90% Random Forest and 10% ANN, achieved a robust accuracy of 80.35% and demonstrated a practical blend of strengths:

Maintained perfect classification for Away_win and Tie outcomes

Improved the recognition of complex patterns compared to individual models

Slightly underperformed on Home_win recall (0.57), suggesting room for further balancing

Despite the limitations, the ensemble showed potential in bridging the generalization power of Random Forest with the pattern-learning depth of ANN, especially when the ANN is retrained with fully pre-match data.

###Conclusion
Each model brought valuable contributions to the task:

The Random Forest stands out as the most stable and interpretable model, with strong predictive performance and minimal overfitting.

The ANN, while currently overperforming due to likely feature leakage, demonstrates great promise and should be refined with stricter data controls.

The ensemble serves as a strong middle-ground solution, particularly effective in enhancing classification of underrepresented outcomes like Tie.

Moving forward, the best strategy would be to:

Retrain the ANN with cleaned features,

Reassess the ensemble’s weight distribution, and

Continue using the Random Forest as a strong, reliable baseline.

This approach ensures we balance predictive power, robustness, and real-world applicability in football match outcome forecasting.
